# MyReads Project

This is the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. The [initial starter template](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter) contained static example of the CSS and HTML markup. It did not have any React code needed to complete the functionality. I added interactivity to the app by refactoring the static code in the template. 

The template also provided a backend server for the project. I did not create the backend. 

## Instruction

* download project files
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
